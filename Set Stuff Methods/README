Set Stuff Methods README

Introduction
--------------------------------------
The purpose of this java project is to implement various methods (created in the setStuff
Coding Bat) in a new class. It also serves as practice for creating good documentation.

Specifications
--------------------------------------
The class successfully implements all of the 11 setStuff methods. The class is well organized,
with each method in corresponding order to the demonstration of itself in the main method. Each method
is clearly explained with block comments.

Errors
--------------------------------------
There are no notable errors.

Overview of Code
--------------------------------------
This project contains just one class, SetStuff. In SetStuff, there are 11 methods from Coding Bat and one
main method. Each of the 11 methods are concise and do not repeat themselves. They are written to compile as
efficiently as possible. In the main method, each method is printed out with an example of a given input and return
value.

Major Challenges
--------------------------------------
Creating the class itself did not prove to be very challenging whereas writing some of the methods on Coding Bat
was difficult. For me, writing nearestUnvisitedNode took the longest because there were many loops I had to keep
track of and some small errors in numbers would prevent the method from functioning.

Acknowledgments
--------------------------------------
I would like to acknowledge tutorialspoint.com and Stack Overflow for certain articles that informed me of the various
JavaDoc tags that I can use to make my documentation as helpful and readable as possible.
