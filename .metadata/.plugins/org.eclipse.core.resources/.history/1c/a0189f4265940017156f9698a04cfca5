Introduction

This purpose of this java program is to display the American flag using
built-in graphics libraries and math mostly compromised of trigonometry.

Specifications

This program fulfills all of the requirements by successfully displaying the US

window is resized, the flag adjusts its proportions accordingly. The flag
also has the most accurate colors possible because the correct hex color codes
were used to replicate "Old Glory Red" and "Old Glory Blue".
